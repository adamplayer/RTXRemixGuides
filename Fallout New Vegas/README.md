## Optional

<!-- Describe any optional programs or steps here. Commonly, it's adding an `asi` mod to the game requiring this brief discription:

Widescreen fix:
> This game has a Widescreenfix available! This greatly enhances the core game to improve compatiablity with modern systems and allows for easy window mode amoung other things. In order to use both RTXRemix and the Widescreenfix, rename `d3d9.dll` from the RTXRemix files to `d3d9.asi`. You can configure the Widescreenfix in the `scripts` folder.

Silentpatch:
> This game has a Silentpatch available! This greatly enhances the core game to improve compatiablity with modern systems and allows for easy window mode amoung other things. In order to use both RTXRemix and the Silentpatch, rename `d3d9.dll` from the RTXRemix files to `d3d9.asi`. You can configure Silentpatch in the `scripts` folder. -->
