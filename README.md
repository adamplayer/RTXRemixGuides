A collection of guides persuding games to accept Nvidia's [RTX-Remix](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/rtx-remix) and how to get them to shine once you do!

## How to use this repo
For Each game has it's own folder to allow for modification and distribution of game specific configuration or tweaks. _Make sure to read the instructions!_ There is also the general `modding` folder that information on what to do once you're ready to start remixing the game.
