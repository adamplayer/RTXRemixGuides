# Tom Clancy Splinter Cell

## Configuration

1. Add dxwrapper with `d3d8.dll` into the `system` folder and configure it for d3d8to9 mode.
2. Add RTXRemix to the `system` folder
3. Add the `rtx.conf` and `dxvk.conf` from this repo to the `system` folder.

### _Optional_
This game has a Widescreenfix available! This greatly enhances the core game to improve compatiablity with modern systems and allows for easy window mode amoung other things. In order to use both RTXRemix and the Widescreenfix, rename `d3d9.dll` from the RTXRemix files to `d3d9.asi`.
